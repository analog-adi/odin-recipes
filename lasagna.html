        <ul type="sphere" class="list-items">
        <li>6 uncooked lasagna noodles</li>

        <li>   3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            
        <li>  2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided </li>
            
        <li>     1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened </li>
            
        <li>  Â¼ cup hot water </li>
            
        <li>    1 cube chicken bouillon </li>
        
        <li>    1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li><br> 
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water, and set aside.        </li>
      <br> <li>Meanwhile, place chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken from the saucepan and shred.</li>
    <br><li>Combine shredded chicken, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and cream cheese in a large bowl. Dissolve hot water and bouillon in a liquid measure; pour over chicken mixture and stir until well combined.</li>
        <br><li>Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the chicken mixture and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.        </li>
       <br> <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes</li>
    </ol>
