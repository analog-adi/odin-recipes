        <li>Wipe off or wash mushrooms in cold water. Pop out stems, reserving both parts.</li>
        <li>Chop mushroom stems finely and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Brown and crumble sausage. Set aside on a plate to cool</li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic to the same skillet; cook for 2 minutes over medium low heat.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine to deglaze pan, allow liquid to evaporate.</li>
        <li>Add in chopped mushroom stems, stir to cook for 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set mixture aside on a plate to cool.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine cream cheese and egg yolk. Stir together with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Add cooled sausage and cooled mushroom stems. Stir mixture together and refrigerate for a short time to firm up.</li>
        <li>Smear mixture into the cavity of each mushroom, creating a sizable mound over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool at least ten minutes before serving; the stuffed mushrooms taste better when not piping hot.</li>
