    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love eggs in every form—scrambled, fried, boiled—but have a special spot in my heart for deviled eggs. While I believe deviled eggs are already a near-perfect side dish, the addition of bang bang sauce—famously found in popular dishes like bang bang shrimp and bang bang chicken—transforms this classic dish into a sweet-spicy-tangy appetizer fit for any party. </p>
        <p>To ensure the perfect deviled eggs, start by making perfectly hard-cooked eggs using our fool-proof Hard-Boiled Eggs recipe. Once you have the eggs, the bang bang sauce complements the salty egg yolks perfectly, resulting in an easy side dish that can be prepared in just ten minutes.</p>
        <p>The best part is, you can make this dish ahead of time. Simply prepare the egg yolk mixture up to two days in advance and store it in an airtight container or piping bag. When you're ready to serve, assemble the deviled eggs and refrigerate until they’re ready to be served.  </p>
